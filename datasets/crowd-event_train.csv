183,anger,"another parent at school wrongly accused my child of saying/doing something that he didn't do. This was not the first time, in fact it had gone on for about two years and this time was the final straw. It was time for me to stick up for my child and put a stop to it once and for all. My child was a target i guess, we had concerns over autism/adhd and this parent really took advantage of that. On this occasion, it was a Friday afternoon and the teacher asked to speak with me, so in i went. I knew it was serious as the Deputy head was also there. They explained that my child (year 3) had told a reception kid that his grandad was going to bring a gun to school (now bear in mind that this parent also knows that we (my husband) has a shotgun licence) and that her child was scared. This was also not the first time that she had made reference to my child and guns at school. I sat, i listened and i thought, its not really my childs style. I asked when this was said and i was told it was said over the xbox. I asked if this was by message or speaking on the mic and the teacher confirmed it was over the mic. This is where i knew that this was not right as my child headset was broken and he was unable to talk to people unless he sent a message! The anger rose up inside me. This parent lives right next to the school and when i left i was so angry that i went to confront and started banging on the door (not like me at all). She wasn't in and in hindsight it was probably a good thing she wasn't in! I was so angry that afternoon that i really dont know what i would have done if she answered as anger had just consumed me. I went home and spoke with my child and he completely denied the allegations and i believed him. I was seething all weekend and by the Monday she contacted me and asked if we could sort things out. Long story short, she admitted that it was a case of he said, she said, Ben said and that she had not hear the words come out of his mouth. This was 6 years ago and still to this day i can not forgive all that she put my child through.","another parent at school wrongly accused my child of saying/doing something that he didn't do.
